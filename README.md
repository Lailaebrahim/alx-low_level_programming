# alx-low_level_programming

Welcome to the **alx-low_level_programming** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of exercises, projects, and notes focused on low-level programming concepts, primarily using the C programming language. It is part of the ALX Software Engineering program, designed to help students build a solid foundation in systems programming, memory management, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

## About

This repository contains solutions and code samples for various low-level programming tasks. The main focus is C programming, but you may also find shell scripts and related resources. The projects cover topics such as:

- Basic C syntax and structure
- Pointers, arrays, and strings
- Functions, recursion, and memory allocation
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees)
- File I/O and system calls
- Algorithms and problem-solving

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lailaebrahim/alx-low_level_programming.git
cd alx-low_level_programming
```

## Prerequisites

- **C Compiler:** GCC is recommended (`sudo apt-get install build-essential`)
- **Make:** For building projects (`sudo apt-get install make`)
- **Shell:** Bash or any POSIX-compliant shell

## How to Use

Navigate into any project directory and compile the C files using GCC:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o output_name
./output_name
```

For scripts, make them executable:

```sh
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```
